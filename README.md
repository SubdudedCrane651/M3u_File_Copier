A Python Tkinter program to copy playlist .M3U to my Mobile files and directories. Added a niffty PyQt5 GUI .m3u editor where it can load and edit the .m3u with delete, add .mp3 files and save the .m3u.

As for the main.py, make sure the .m3u uses the relative path meaning to remove D:\Music\ and keep just \ and the use source path as D:\Music and chose a different destination path.
